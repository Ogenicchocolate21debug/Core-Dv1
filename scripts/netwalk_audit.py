"""Hardening audit for netwalk: vendor best practice, checked in code.

Before this existed, "is anything configured badly?" depended on whether the agent
remembered a paragraph of examples while it was busy reading interface counters. That
is not a check, it is a hope. This module is the checklist as data - every item has an
id, a severity, the evidence that decides it, a fix a technician can apply, and a
reference to where the rule comes from.

Two things make it safe to run against a real customer:

  * **It reads the config export off the disk, not through the conversation.** The
    exports already live in `<site>/configs/` because `netwalk_exec.py --out` put them
    there. This script opens them locally and emits findings; the config text itself
    never enters an agent's context. Excerpts attached to a finding are one line long
    and pass through the same redactor the exec wrapper uses.
  * **It never fails silently.** A check whose evidence is missing is reported as NOT
    CHECKED, by name. A hardening report that quietly skipped half its checks is worse
    than no report, because it reads like a clean bill of health.

Where the rules come from
-------------------------
The vendor's own hardening guidance, plus what actually goes wrong on sites. Each check
names the guidance it comes from, so a customer asking "says who?" gets an answer that
points at the people who built the box rather than at this file.
